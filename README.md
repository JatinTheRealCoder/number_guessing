# Number Guessing Game in Python

This is a simple Python-based number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

---

## How It Works

- The computer randomly picks a number between **1 and 100**.
- The player has **5 attempts** to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program tells the player if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- If the player guesses correctly, a congratulatory message is shown.
- If the player fails to guess in 5 attempts, the correct number is revealed.
